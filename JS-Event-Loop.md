## The Event Loop in JavaScript

**Explanation:**

The Event Loop is the core mechanism in JavaScript that allows it to handle asynchronous operations, even though it's single-threaded. In essence, it's a continuous loop that checks if the call stack is empty. If it is, it takes the next event from the event queue and puts it on the call stack to be executed. 

Key components:

* **Call Stack:** This is where function execution happens. When a function is called, it's added to the stack. When it returns, it's removed.
* **Event Queue:** This is where asynchronous events (like user clicks, network requests, timers) wait to be processed. 
* **Web APIs:** These are browser-provided APIs that handle asynchronous tasks like timers (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`) or network requests (`fetch`). They offload the work to the browser and, when done, add a callback to the event queue.
* **Microtask Queue:** This is a separate queue with higher priority than the event queue, used for tasks like promise resolution. It's processed before the event queue in each loop iteration.

**Sample Code:**

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Inside setTimeout");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("Inside Promise");
});

console.log("End");
```

**Output:**

```
Start
End
Inside Promise
Inside setTimeout
```

**Explanation of Output:**

1. `console.log("Start")`: This is synchronous, so it executes immediately and prints "Start".
2. `setTimeout(...)`: The `setTimeout` function with a 0ms delay is called. This schedules the callback function to be executed "as soon as possible" but after the current code finishes. The actual execution is handled by a Web API, and the callback is added to the event queue.
3. `Promise.resolve().then(...)`: This creates a resolved promise, and the callback function is added to the microtask queue.
4. `console.log("End")`: This is synchronous and prints "End".
5. At this point, the call stack is empty.
6. The event loop checks the microtask queue, finds the promise callback, and puts it on the call stack. It executes, printing "Inside Promise".
7. The microtask queue is now empty. The event loop checks the event queue, finds the `setTimeout` callback, and puts it on the call stack. It executes, printing "Inside setTimeout". 

**Key Takeaway:** Even though `setTimeout` has a 0ms delay, it's executed after the promise callback because the microtask queue has higher priority. This demonstrates how the event loop manages asynchronous operations to ensure smooth and responsive execution.
